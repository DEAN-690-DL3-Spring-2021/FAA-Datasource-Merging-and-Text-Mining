WHEN HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE ENGINE TO CRANK I VERIFIED THAT THE MASTER SWITCH WAS ON AND TRIED TO START THE ENGINE MYSELF WITH THE SAME RESULT OF NO ABILITY TO CRANK THE ENGINE TO RESTART. WE WERE TRAVELING IN A GENERALLY SOUTHEAST DIRECTION WHEN THE ENGINE QUIT SO I STARTED A SLOW TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST WHERE THERE WAS MORE OPEN AREA WITH FEWER SURFACE STRUCTURES. AS WE GLIDED SOUTHWEST I TRIED THE STARTER SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE SAME RESULT OF NO ABILLITY TO CRANK THE ENGINE. AS WE GLIDED TOWARD THE FARM FIELD I EXTENDED THE FLAPS AND TRIED THE STARTER ONE LAST TIME WITH THE SAME NEGATIVE RESULT. I THEN TURNED OFF THE MASTER SWITCH AND FUEL SELECTOR.  I ADVISED MY STUDENT TO TIGHTEN HIS SEAT BELT AND UNLATCH HIS DOOR,  I DID THE SAME AND ACCEPTED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO LAND. WE LANDED WITH FULL FLAPS AT MINIMUM SPEED IN A FIELD IRRIGATED BY A CENTER PIVOT SPRINKLER SYSTEM THAT WAS SAFELY ON THE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD WE WERE USING FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING. WE ROLLED ALMOST TO A STOP BEFORE THE AIRPLANE SANK INTO THE VERY SOFT SURFACE AND NOSED OVER BUT DID NOT GO INVERTED.

A DECISION WAS MADE TO ATTEMPT THE FIRST LANDING AT KTBR ON A 45 DEGREE DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 32.  THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT IT WAS DISCUSSED WITH THE STUDENT TO TOUCHDOWN AT THE 1000 FOOT MARKER.  ATOS REPORTED THAT WINDS WERE GUSTING FROM 14 TO 18 KNOTS.  THE CREW SLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO 90 KNOTS ON SHORT FINAL WHEN ALL OF SUDDEN THE AIRCRAFT ABRUPTLY SANK AND NOSED DOWN.  THIS CAUSED THE CREW TO INITIATE AN IMMEDIATE GO AROUND PROCEDURE.

"THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE PILOT STATEMENT: AS THE AIRCRAFT SLOWED, I ALSO PUT IN 18° FLAPS (SECOND POSITION) AND SET THE PROPELLER TO HIGH RPM BUT DID NOT COMPLETE THE REMAINING ELEMENTS OF CONFIGURING THE AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING SINCE I NOTICED THERE WAS NO GREEN GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED LIGHT WHILE SETTING THE PROPELLER.  MY FIRST ACTION AT THAT POINT WAS A QUICK CHECK THAT THE NAVIGATION LIGHTS WERE OFF SINCE WHEN THEY ARE ON THE GEAR POSITION INDICATOR LIGHTS ARE VERY DIM AND CANNOT BE SEEN IN DAYLIGHT. MY 2ND ACTION WAS TO LOOK AT THE GEAR EXTENSION LEVER AND I VERIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT FULLY FORWARD, BUT ALSO THAT THERE WAS NOT SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR BLOCKING ITS TRAVEL. THAT CONFIRMED AND NEAR THE THRESHOLD AND ABOUT 150 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I ADDED POWER AND CALLED THE TOWER TO REPORT THE LANDING GEAR PROBLEM. I ASKED THE TOWER IF THEY COULD LOOK AT THE GEAR AS I MADE A LOW PASS ON THE RUNWAY ALIGNMENT.  THEY DID AND INDICATED THE GEAR APPEARED TO BE PARTIALLY EXTENDED. THEY ASKED MY INTENTIONS AND I STATED THAT I WOULD FLY OUT TO THE EAST AND TRY TO RECYCLE THE GEAR. I ADDED POWER, PITCHED UP AND RAISED THE FLAPS IN A MORE OR LESS STANDARD GO AROUND PROCEDURE.  DURING THAT PROCEDURE I MOVED THE GEAR SELECTOR SWITCH TO THE UP POSITION AND THE GEAR RETRACTED NORMALLY. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS ESTABLISHED IN A CLIMB, I TRIED TO LOWER THE GEAR AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT, BUT DURING THE RETRACTION I AM NOT SURE THE YELLOW FULLY RETRACTED LIGHT CAME ON.  THE TOWER INDICATED THAT I SHOULD MONITOR THE TOWER FREQUENCY AND KEEP THEM ADVISED OF MY SITUATION.  THEY ALSO INDICATED THERE WAS TRAFFIC IN THE AREA, SOME OF WHICH THEY WERE NOT TALKING TO.  THEY GAVE ME AN ADVISORY FOR SOME SPECIFIC TRAFFIC ON A CONVERGING COURSE AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ALTITUDE. I ADVISED THE TOWER I HAD THE TRAFFIC VISUALLY AND WOULD AVOID.  ",,,,,,,,,

THE PILOT DID NOT RECALL SEEING ANY WARNINGS OR INDICATIONS DURING THIS TIME BUT N395AE BEGAN LOSING POWER AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO DESCEND. SECURITY VIDEO SHOWED THAT WITH THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT SLIGHTLY PITCH UP, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND HITTING THE AFT SECTION OF THE SKIDS AND TAIL SECTION FIRST. THE FORCE OF THE INITIAL IMPACT RESULTED IN N395AE BOUNCING TO THE RIGHT AND LANDING UPRIGHT ON THE AIRCRAFT?S SKIDS. DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT INCLUDED SEPARATION OF TAIL VERTICAL STABILIZER FROM THE TAIL BOOM. THE BOTTOM OF THE TAIL VERTICAL STABILIZER WITH THE STINGER WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET FROM WHERE THE AIRCRAFT LANDED. THERE ALSO APPEARED TO BE MAIN ROTOR AND TAIL ROTOR DAMAGE, ALONG WITH THE FRONT RIGHT TRANSPARENCY BROKEN AND THE SKIDS SPREAD APART. AFTER THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST, THE PILOT ROLLED THE THROTTLE TO IDLE TO START AN ENGINE SHUTDOWN, SHUT OFF THE FUEL VALVE IN CASE OF A FIRE, APPLIED THE ROTOR BRAKE AND ALL ONBOARD EXITED THE AIRCRAFT SAFELY.",,,,,,,,,
"UPON INITIAL VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE AT THE SCENE, THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF ANY LEAKING FLUIDS OR LINES DISCONNECTED. THE ENGINE INLET FAIRING WAS CLEAN AND NO DAMAGE OR DEBRIS COULD BEEN SEEN AT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPRESSOR SECTION. AN AIRCRAFT FUEL SAMPLE WAS TAKEN ON SCENE AND NO VISIBLE DEBRIS OR WATER WAS FOUND. OTHER THAN THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE GROUND IMPACT, NO DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED.",,,,,,,,,
"AFTER DISCUSSING WITH THE NTSB THE AIRCRAFT CREW?S STATEMENTS AND THE FAA?S VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, THE NTSB COORDINATED A MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE AND N395AE WAS SENT TO A REPAIR STATION IN BROUSSARD, LOUISIANA. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE NTSB, FAA, ENGINE MANUFACTURER, AIR OPERATOR AND REPAIR STATION PARTICIPATED IN THE INSPECTION. SAMPLES WERE TAKEN OF THE ENGINE OIL AND FUEL FILTER AND ROTATION OF THE COMPRESSOR, TURBINE AND MAIN DRIVE SHAFT WERE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ANY DISCREPANCIES. THE ENGINE WAS THEN REMOVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND PLACED IN A TEST CELL FOR RUN-UP. THE FIRST ENGINE START WAS ABORTED DUE TO INDICATIONS OF AN UNUSUALLY HIGH ADVANCING TURBINE OUTLET TEMPERATURE. AFTER A SECOND ABORTED START, THE FUEL NOZZLE SPRAY PATTERN AND INSTALLATION DEPTH WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE NORMAL. A THIRD START WAS PERFORMED AND THE THROTTLE WAS ADVANCED TO IDLE. DURING THIS START, THE TURBINE OUTLET TEMPERATURE AND COMPRESSOR VIBRATIONS WERE BOTH HIGHER THAN NORMAL. THE THROTTLE WAS THEN ADVANCED TO SEE IF 100% COULD BE ACHIEVED BUT AT APPROXIMATELY 70-75% THERE WAS AN INCREASINGLY LOUD DEEP BUZZING NOISE WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND OUT OF LIMIT COMPRESSOR IMBALANCE LEVEL. THE ENGINE WAS RETURNED TO IDLE AND SHUT DOWN. THE COMPRESSOR SECTION WAS THEN REMOVED AND DISASSEMBLED. DURING DISASSEMBLY IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DIFFUSER ASSEMBLY PART NUMBER 23051119AL HAD FAILED WITH THE FRONT SHIELD COMPLETELY UNBONDED FROM THE VANES OF THE ASSEMBLY BUT NO OTHER SIGNS OF FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE OR FAILURES WERE FOUND. ",,,,,,,,,
CURRENTLY THE COMPRESSOR DIFFUSER IS BEING ANALYZED BY THE NTSB TO IDENTIFY A CAUSE OF THE DEBONDING FAILURE.,,,,,,,,,

20190527005229A,"ON MAY 27, 2019 AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 EST, N1797E, A TAIL WHEELED AERONCA 7AC AIRPLANE CONDUCTING A PART 91 FLIGHT, WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AT COORDINATES 33°02?37? NORTH AND 84°25?55? WEST. ON BOARD THE AIRCRAFT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS ONLY THE PILOT WHO REPORTED TO HAVE NO INJURIES AS A RESULT. AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE, THE PILOT WAS GIVEN THE COMPLIANCE PHILOSOPHY AND AIRMAN RIGHTS BROCHURE THAT IDENTIFIED THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS DUE TO N1797E?S ACCIDENT. PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD TAKEN OFF FROM WINDRIFT AERODROME (2GA5) FOR A SHORT FLIGHT AND RETURNED FOR LANDING AT THE SAME RUNWAY WITH THE INTENTIONS OF MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN AND TAKING OFF AGAIN. DURING THE LANDING ROLL OUT PHASE, THE PILOT CLAIMED HE APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE LEFT BRAKE TO MAKE HIS PLANNED LEFT HAND TURN BUT THE BRAKE DID NOT SEEM TO RESPOND. THE PILOT THEN DECIDED TO TAP THE RIGHT BRAKE IN AN ATTEMPT TO TROUBLESHOOT A POSSIBLE BRAKE MALFUNCTION. AFTER TAPPING THE RIGHT BRAKE, THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO VEER TO THE RIGHT SO HE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE BRAKE BUT THE RIGHT BRAKE LOCKED UP AND WOULD NOT DISENGAGE. THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO VEER TO THE RIGHT WITH ENOUGH SPEED TO CLEAR OVER A SMALL DITCH, WHICH RUNS PARALLEL NEXT TO THE RUNWAY, CROSSED OVER A DIRT ROAD (COLLIER ROAD) AND IMMEDIATELY ENTERED A SMALL OPENING BETWEEN TWO TREES. FORTUNATELY, THE OPENING WAS WIDE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE?S FUSELAGE AND PILOT FROM RECEIVING ANY DIRECT DAMAGE FROM THE TREES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE AIRPLANE?S WINGSPAN LENGTH EXCEEDED THE OPENING AND AS A RESULT THE WINGS COLLIDED WITH THE TREE ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT. THE DAMAGE INCLUDED THE RIGHT WING ALMOST BEING COMPLETELY SEVERED AT APPROXIMATELY A FOOT INBOARD OF THE RIGHT HAND AILERON AND THE LEFT WING BEING COMPLETELY CRUMPLED WITH THE WING SEVERED FROM THE LEADING EDGE BACK TO WHERE THE LEFT HAND AILERON?S LEADING INBOARD EDGE BEGINS. THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT CAUSED BOTH WINGS TO BE FOLDED BACK TO THE POINT THAT THE WING TIPS LAY NEXT TO THE AIRPLANE?S HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. THE PILOT WAS FORCED TO CRAWL OUT THE LEFT HAND WINDOW DUE TO THE RIGHT HAND DOOR BEING JAMMED CLOSED BY THE DAMAGED WING. DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE WINGS, A FUEL LEAK OCCURRED BUT NO FIRE ENSUED. N1797E?S OWNER STATED AT THE SCENE THAT SHE HAD FLOWN THE AIRPLANE SINCE THE ANNUAL AND SHE HAD EXPERIENCED NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES BUT THE AIRPLANE DID HAVE A HISTORY OF BRAKE ISSUES. AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT, THE PILOT COULD NOT PROVIDE A PILOT?S LICENSE OR MEDICAL CERTIFICATE SO THE PILOT?S DRIVER?S LICENSE WAS USED FOR IDENTIFICATION. N1797E?S LAST ANNUAL WAS COMPLETED ON MAY 07, 2019 WITH A TACHOMETER TIME OF 616.97 HOURS AND AN AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME OF APPROXIMATELY 3061.6 HOURS. ON JUNE 20, 2019 AN INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON N1797E?S BRAKES. AN OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE BRAKES REVEALED NO DISCREPANCIES BUT AFTER THE BRAKE DISASSEMBLY, A SLOW HYDRAULIC LEAK FROM THE RIGHT HAND CALIPER SEAL WAS DISCOVERED. AS A RESULT, IT APPEARED THAT THE HYDRAULIC FLUID HAD TRANSFERRED TO THE BRAKE PADS AND HAD STARTED TO ACCUMULATE ON THE BRAKE DISC BUT NO OTHER ABNORMALITIES WERE FOUND.",,,,,,,,

THE PILOT MADE A STOP AT CINCINNATI LUNKEN AIRPORT TO DROP OFF A PASSENGER BEFORE CONTINUING TO GEAUGA COUNTY. WEATHER CONTAINING HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IN THE NORTHEAST OHIO AREA CAUSED THE PILOT TO STOP BRIEFLY AT WOOSTER/ WAYNE COUNTY AIRPORT (KBJJ) TO WAIT FOR THE WEATHER TO CLEAR.

"MISHAP SORTIE WAS THE SECOND INSTRUCTIONAL SORTIE FOR THE MSP.  THE MISHAP SORTIE WAS BRIEFED TO BE FLOWN FROM FAIRBANKS (PAFA) TO THE MINTO LAKES AREA.  ITEMS BRIEFED WERE A REVIEW OF NORMAL PROCEDURES, GLASSY WATER TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS, ROUGH WATER TAKEOFF AND LANDINGS AND CONFINED SPACE PROCEDURES.   PREFLIGHT WAS COMPLETED AND SORTIE DEPARTED APPROXIMATELY 1415L.  PREFLIGHT WEATHER AND NOTMAS WERE CHECKED USING FOREFLIGHT.  WEATHER WAS VMC WITH LIGHT WINDS.  TAKEOFF AND DEPARTURE, USING TRSA SERVICES WAS NORMAL.  THE NEXT TWO LANDINGS WERE GLASSY WATER LANDINGS WITH SMALL INPUTS FROM THE MIP, FOLLOWED BY TWO ROUGH WATER LANDINGS WITH INPUTS FROM THE MIP.  THE MISHAP FLIGHT THEN DEPARTED TO THE WEST APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES TO PRACTICE CONFINED SPACE LANDINGS ON A SLOUGH.  THE MIP PILOT SHOWED THE MSP WHERE HE WANTED HIM TO LAND.  THE LANDING WAS EXECUTED TO A STEP TAXI TO THE FAR END OF THE SLOUGH, WITH SMALL INSTRUCTOR INPUTS.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS TURNED AROUND ON THE SLOUGH USING DISPLACEMENT TAXI.  PRE-TAKEOFF CHECKS WERE COMPLETED AND THE MSP BEGAN THE TAKEOFF.  THE BEGINNING OF THE TAKEOFF WAS NORMAL.  THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED ONTO THE ?STEP? AND BEGAN ACCELERATING.  JUST PRIOR TO LIFTOFF THE MSP MADE A RATHER ABRUPT ATTEMPT TO ROTATE THE AIRCRAFT OUT OF THE WATER, PRIOR TO FLYING SPEED, AGGRESSIVELY DIGGING THE HEALS OF THE FLOATS INTO THE WATER SLOWING THE MISHAP AIRCRAFT SIGNIFICANTLY.  THE MIP TOOK CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND PUSHED THE AIRCRAFT BACK ONTO THE STEP.  SHORTLY AFTER THAT POINT THE INSTRUCTOR DECIDED THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT WATER REMAINING TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TAKEOFF.  THE MIP RETARDED THE THROTTLE TO IDLE AND ABORTED THE TAKEOFF.  THE MISHAP AIRCRAFT CONTACTED LAND JUST AS IT WAS COMING OFF THE STEP, SLIDING THROUGH THE WET GRASS UNTIL IT HIT A SMALL MOUND WITH THE LEFT FLOAT.  THIS LIFTED UP THE LEFT WING ENOUGH FOR THE RIGHT WINGTIP TO CONTRACT THE GROUND DAMAGING THE RIGHT WING.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS SHUT DOWN AND SECURED.  NO INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED TO MSP OR MIP.",,,,,,,,,

ANALYSIS OF INCIDENT INVOLVING N5771P,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"AS YOU KNOW I WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT INVOLVING N5771P.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF  LITTLE MISTAKES THAT ALONE ARE NOT A HUGE DEAL, BUT IN COMBINATION LED TO AN INCIDENT.  AN IN FLIGHT DISTRACTION LED ME TO BEING A BIT HIGH AND A BIT FAST FOR A STRAIGHT IN APPROACH TO W10.  I ALMOST NEVER DO STRAIGHT IN APPROACHES, BUT WE WERE HEADING NORTH AND LANDING NORTH AT AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT.  BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE HIGH AND A LITTLE FAST, I LOWERED MY GEAR A LITTLE FASTER THAN I USUALLY DO, SLOWED, AND ADDED FLAPS.  I AM COMFORTABLE SLIPPING THE AIRPLANE AND SCRUBBED THE EXTRA ALTITUDE WITH NO PROBLEMS.  BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF MY ROUTINE I HAVE WITH NORMAL PATTERN WORK I DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE GEAR MOTOR CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS TRIPPED.  NOT ONCE DID I PUT MY HAND UNDER THE LANDING GEAR LIGHT AND SAY OUT LOUD THAT I HAD A GREEN LIGHT.  I DID NOT PUT MY HAND ON THE GEAR HANDLE AND CONFIRM IT WAS IN THE RIGHT SPOT.  BECAUSE I WAS SLIPPING IN, I WAS CARRYING A LITTLE MORE POWER THAN I NORMALLY DO TO MAKE SURE MY ROUND OUT WAS SMOOTH AND UNEVENTFUL.  FOR THAT REASON, AS I WAS SLOWING INTO MY FLARE, THE HORN SAYING THE GEAR WASN?T DOWN DIDN?T ACTIVATE BECAUSE IT HAD NOT REACHED ITS LIMIT TO SOUND. ( BELIEVE ME? I CHECKED TO SEE IF IT WAS WORKING AFTER THE INCIDENT AND IT SCREAMED LOUDLY AT ME )  I HAD ABOUT A .3 SECOND THOUGHT THAT THE AIRPLANE WAS AT AN ATTITUDE I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH (WHY HAVEN?T MY WHEELS HIT YET?) AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL NOISE.  YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY.",,,,,,,,,
LESSONS LEARNED:,,,,,,,,,
1,NO STRAIGHT IN APPROACHES.  PATTERN WORK IS SAFER AND IT GIVES YOU MULTIPLE TIMES TO GO OVER GUMP.  ENTERING THE 45 GUMP.  DOWNWIND GUMP.  BASE GUMP.  FINAL GUMP.,,,,,,,,
2,"IF YOU ARE HIGH, FAST, OR BOTH, DIVERT THEN RE-ENTER THE PATTERN AT THE NORMAL PATTERN SPEED AND ALTITUDE.",,,,,,,,
3,"DISTRACTIONS ARE EXACTLY THAT.  THEY HAPPEN.  IF THEY DO, FLY THE AIRPLANE.  FIX THE PROBLEM.  TAKE A DEEP BREATH, AND GET BACK TO THE CONSISTENT BASICS OF FLYING PATTERN WORK.",,,,,,,,
4,DID I HAPPEN TO MENTION GUMP?,,,,,,,,
ACTION PLAN:,,,,,,,,,
"ANALYZE WHAT HAPPENED.  LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES.  MOVE FORWARD.  MY AIRPLANE WILL BE REPAIRED AND THE HUGE DENT TO MY PRIDE WILL FADE OVER TIME, BUT NEVER LEAVE ME.  I KNOW THIS WILL MAKE ME A BETTER, EVEN SAFER PILOT.  YOU WILL NOT HEAR OF N5771P HAVING ANOTHER GEAR UP LANDING WHILE I AM PIC.",,,,,,,,,

"AIRCRAFT OWNER/BUILDER IS A STUDENT PILOT WHO WAS FLYING WITH HIS CFI PRACTICING LANDINGS. THEY HAD BEEN FLYING OUT OF THE NEARBY PAVED AIR STRIP THAT MORNING AND THE CFI DECIDED THAT THE STUDENT'S LANDINGS WERE GOING WELL AND THEY COULD FLY OVER TO THE STUDENT'S PRIVATE GRASS AIRSTRIP TO PRACTICE LANDINGS. THE NEXT DAY, THE CFI BROUGHT THE PLANE OVER TO THE STUDENT'S STRIP TO PICK UP THE STUDENT AND BEGIN GRASS STRIP LANDING PRACTICE. ",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"THE STUDENT AND CFI DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AND CAME BACK AROUND FOR THEIR FIRST LANDING OF THE DAY. UPON LANDING, THE STUDENT BOUNCED THE AIRCRAFT BACK INTO THE AIR. THE STUDENT ADDED THROTTLE TO GO AROUND BUT THEY WERE RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT OF RUNWAY AND OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE. THE CFI TOOK THE CONTROLS AND KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CRASH, SO HE ELECTED TO TURN THE AIRCRAFT A FEW DEGREES TO THE RIGHT IN ORDER TO CRASH THE AIRCRAFT BETWEEN TWO LARGE TREES. ",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE TREES UPRIGHT AND THE MAIN ENERGY OF THE CRASH WAS ABSORBED BY THE LARGE TREES. THE CFI AND THE STUDENT BOTH SUFFERED INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION. ,,,,,,,,,
"UPON VISITING THE STUDENT AND THE CFI IN THE HOSPITAL ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT IT WAS APPARENT THAT THERE WAS A MISCOMMUNICATION DURING THE LANDING AND ATTEMPTED GO-AROUND. THE STUDENT STATED THAT HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE CFI SAY ""DON'T LAND"" AFTER THE BOUNCE, SO HE APPLIED FULL POWER TO TRY AND GO-AROUND WITH INSUFFICIENT ROOM REMAINING IN THE DEPARTURE PATH. THE CFI STATED THAT AFTER THE STUDENT BOUNCED HE TOLD THE STUDENT TO ""LAND."" THE CFI ASSUMED THE STUDENT WAS GOING TO REDUCE POWER TO IDLE AND LAND ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY AND THE CFI WAS CAUGHT OFF-GUARD WHEN THE STUDENT ADDED FULL POWER AND PITCHED UP. BY THIS TIME THE CFI REALIZED THEY WERE OUT OF TIME AND TOOK THE CONTROLS LEADING UP TO THE CRASH. THE CFI ADMITTED THAT THE CRASH WAS FULLY HIS RESPONSIBILITY AND HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE CONTROLS SOONER. ",,,,,,,,,

"ON FRIDAY, 20 SEPTEMBER 2019 AIRCRAFT N569JC WAS ON ITS SECOND SORTIE OF THE DAY WITH PIC AND THREE PASSENGERS ON BOARD.  ONE OF THE PASSENGERS IS THE AIRCRAFT OWNER.  TAKEOFF WAS NORMAL AND AFTER A FEW MANEUVERS, THE PILOT INTENDED TO DO ONE TOUCH AND GO AT LNC FOLLOWED BY LANDING AT LNC, END OF FLIGHT.  ON THE GO AROUND THERE IS A VIBRATION AND BACK FIRE FROM THE ENGINE, ALONG WITH UNUSUAL NOISES.

FACTS FROM INVESTIGATION OF THE SCENE:,,,,,,,,,
"THE FIELD THE AIRCRAFT LANDED IN WAS PLOWED AND SOFT WITH RAISED ROWS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE AIRCRAFT INITIAL TOUCH-DOWN HEADING.  THE INITIAL IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT EVIDENT BY ANY MARKS ON THE GROUND, PROBABLY DUE TO THE ROUGH/BROKEN SURFACE.  A DEBRIS FIELD WAS EVIDENT, CONTAINING MOSTLY BROKEN COMPOSITE WHEEL SKIRTS FROM ALL THREE WHEELS.  THERE WAS ALSO SOME DUCTING AND A VALVE BROKEN FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE AS THE NOSE GEAR BROKE AND THE LOWER ENGINE COWL DUG INTO THE GROUND.  THE BEGINNING OF THE DEBRIS FIELD IS APPROXIMATELY 25 YARDS FROM AIRCRAFT.  THE DEBRIS FIELD AND THE STATEMENT FROM MR. YOHE SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE INITIAL IMPACT WAS HARD AND ONLY ON THE MAINS.  THIS BROKE THE MAIN WHEEL SKIRTS AND SPREAD THE MAINS APART.  IT APPEARS THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED AND THEN HIT HARD ON NOSE GEAR SHEARING IT OFF, ALONG WITH ALL REMAINING WHEEL SKIRT MATERIAL.  THE AIRCRAFT THEN HIT NOSE LOW BREAKING OFF THE DUCTING AND VALVE WHICH WERE CLOSEST TO THE AIRCRAFT?S FINAL RESTING PLACE.  THE LEFT MAIN GEAR WAS PUSHED INTO BOTTOM OF WING AND UNABLE TO TURN WHICH SEEMED TO CAUSE THE 90 LEFT ROTATION AT THE FINAL FEW FEET OF THE SLIDE.  THE PROP HAD BOTH BLADES BENT BACK WITH TIP DAMAGE INDICATING CONTACT WITH GROUND.  BOTH OF THE WINGS HAVE WRINKLES IN UPPER SKINS AND BOTH HAVE DAMAGE AT OUTER TIPS; THE LEFT WING HAS SUBSTANTIAL TIP DAMAGE.",,,,,,,,,

PILOTS DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT:,,,,,,,,,
"THE AIRCRAFT IS A KR-2 N6242 EA-B, BUILT FROM VENDOR PLANS BY MYSELF. THIS MODEL IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE RESPONSIVE IN HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS.  THE AIRCRAFT IS IN PHASE I FLIGHT TEST.  THIS EVENT WAS THE FIFTH FLIGHT.  MODIFICATIONS HAD BEEN COMPLETED TO MITIGATE AFT CG ISSUES FOUND IN THE FIRST FOUR FLIGHTS.  THE COCKPIT HAD ALSO BEEN MODIFIED TO CONVERT FROM TWO-PLACE SIDE BY SIDE TO SINGLE-PLACE FOR BETTER ERGONOMICS.  FUEL ONBOARD MEASURED 6 GALLONS RIGHT TANK, 7 GALLONS LEFT TANK. TOTAL CAPACITY IS 15 GALLONS.  WEATHER CONDITIONS: CLEAR SKY, VISIBILITY GREATER THAN 10 MILES, WIND FROM THE SOUTH AT LESS THAN 5 KNOTS RESULTING IN A DIRECT CROSSWIND COMPONENT, GUSTS WERE 0 TO 5 KNOTS, WINDSOCK FAVORED USING RUNWAY 29.  TAKEOFF HAD NO ISSUES.  CLIMBED EASILY TO 2500 FEET TO THE PRACTICE AREA 5 MILES NORTH OF K2W6.  EXPLORED HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS.  ABOUT 5 KNOTS PRIOR TO EACH STALL, GOT SOME SLIGHT AIRFRAME BUFFET AND ELEVATOR STICK SHAKE.  DETERMINED POWER OFF STALLS TO BE 57 KNOTS CLEAN AND 52 KNOTS FULL FLAPS, NO INDICATION OF WING DROP.  SHALLOW AND STEEP TURNS UP TO 45 DEGREES BANK DID NOT REQUIRE RUDDER INPUT FOR COORDINATION, AS EXPECTED.  ALL AIR SPEEDS ARE INDICATED.  LEVEL CRUISE SPEED WAS 124 KNOTS AT 2500 FEET AND 3000 RPM USING A 52X52 WOOD PROP. OAT WAS 16 DEGREES C.",,,,,,,,,
"RETURNED TO K2W6 AND ENTERED THE 29 PATTERN CROSS WIND AT 1000 FEET MSL.  WIND SOCK FAVORED RUNWAY 29.  MADE RADIO CALLS FOR INBOUND, CROSS WIND, DOWN WIND, LEFT BASE AND FINAL.  THERE WAS NO OTHER AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC EITHER ON THE GROUND OR AIRBORNE.  THE PLAN WAS TO MAKE TWO TOUCH-AND-GOES AND THEN A FULL STOP.  THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST USE OF FLAPS FOR LANDING N6242. MY FIRST APPROACH USING FULL FLAPS WAS AT 65 KNOTS, BUT TO HIGH OVER THE THRESHOLD, SO EXECUTED A GO-AROUND.  DOWN LOW UNDER 50 FEET AGL THE CROSSWIND REQUIRED A SLIGHT CRAB AND ALSO HAD SOME LIGHT GUSTS.  THE NEXT FULL FLAP APPROACH CROSSED THE 29 THRESHOLD AT ABOUT 30 FEET AGL AND 65 KNOTS.  ABOUT 2 FEET AGL A SUDDEN GUST PICKED UP THE LEFT WING JUST AS I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OUT THE LEFT CRAB.  I COUNTERED WITH LEFT ROLL AND RIGHT RUDDER.  BOTH INPUTS WERE OVER-CONTROLLED AND PIO STARTED.  THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE RUNWAY FOR A HARD LANDING IN A LEVEL ATTITUDE.  ROLLOUT WAS TRACKING ON THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE NOSE STARTED A GRADUAL UNCOMMANDED PITCH DOWN.  FULL AFT STICK WOULD NOT STOP THE PITCH DOWN.  THE PROP IMPACTED THE RUNWAY AND YAWED THE NOSE TO THE LEFT APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES.  NOW SLIDING ON THE NOSE, THE AIRCRAFT WAS HEADING IN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE LEFT EDGE OF THE RUNWAY.  MAIN GEAR WHEELS WERE FUNCTIONAL.  RIGHT RUDDER AND BRAKING WAS NIL.  AS THE NOSE IMPACTED THE GRASS, THE AIRCRAFT YAWED QUICKLY TO THE LEFT IN A GROUND LOOP.  THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED AND THE RIGHT WING TIP SCRAPPED ON THE EDGE OF THE RUNWAY.  TOTAL TURN FOR THE GROUND LOOP WAS ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF A TURN.  THE AIRCRAFT STOPPED OFF THE RUNWAY PAVEMENT EDGE.  ",,,,,,,,,
"BEFORE SECURING THE AIRCRAFT I MADE A RADIO CALL TO ALERT ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT THAT MY AIRCRAFT WAS BLOCKING THE RUNWAY.  WHEN I SHUT OFF THE IGNITION, THE ENGINE STOPPED AND THE JAGGED STUB OF ONE WOOD PROP BLADE SUDDENLY APPEARED OVER THE COWL.  A CONSTRUCTION WORKER FROM THE TAXIWAY RE-CONSTRUCTION JOB SITE WAS THE FIRST RESPONDER.  I WAS NOT INJURED; SEAT BELTS DO WORK.  I ASSISTED THE AIRPORT MANAGER AND THE SKYTECH FBO PERSONNEL WITH A RUNWAY FOD WALK DOWN PICKING UP PROP SPLINTERS AND BITS OF FIBERGLASS.  THE NOSE GEAR WAS FOUND ABOUT TEN FEET FROM THE AIRCRAFT IN THE GRASS AT THE RUNWAY EDGE.  THE COLLAPSED RIGHT MAIN GEAR LEG WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE AIRCRAFT.  PERRY BENSHOOF, WASHINGTON FSDO, RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT AND AUTHORIZED MOVEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

"ONCE IN COMMUNICATION WITH ZHU, MRA679 MADE APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 23 HEADING CHANGES AND COURSE REVERSALS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN A STABLE ALTITUDE OR AIRSPEED (BASED ON GROUNDSPEED ADS-B RECORDINGS). DURING THOSE HEADING CHANGES, ZHU ASKED MRA679 TO SAY HEADING OR TO CORRECT HEADING. MOST OF THE TIME MRA679 RESPONDED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, HOWEVER, SOME OF THE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE UNINTELLIGIBLE. MRA679 NEVER INDICATED ANY TROUBLE OVER THE RADIO UNTIL 2011CST AFTER ZHU STATED THAT HEADING WASN'T BEING MAINTAINED. AT THAT POINT, MRA679 REPORTED HAVING INSTRUMENT PROBLEMS. THE CONTROLLER ASKED MRA679 IF HE WANTED TO RETURN TO KVCT, TO WHICH MRA679 STATED HE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO KIAH. AT 2012CST, ZHU ADVISED MRA679 OF BEING 7 MILES NORTHEAST AT 3,700 FEET. MRA679 RESPONDED THAT HE WANTED TO COME BACK TO KVCT. MRA679 WAS INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN 3,000 FEET, WAS GIVEN THE GENERAL LOCATION OF THE AIRPORT AND TO REPORT THE FIELD IN SIGHT. AT 2013CST, ZHU INSTRUCTED MRA679 TO MAINTAIN 4,000 FEET, WHICH MRA679'S RESPONSE WAS TO REQUEST 3,000 FEET INSTEAD. AT 2014CST, MRA679 WAS ASKED IF THE AIRPORT WAS IN SIGHT, TO WHICH MRA679 REPORTED AS CURRENTLY LOOKING. ZHU RESPONDED BY CLEARING MRA679 FOR THE VISUAL APPROACH 13L. SHORTLY AFTER THAT TRANSMISSION, BOUTIQUE FLIGHT 465, A FLIGHT DEPARTING FROM KVCT, STATED OVER THE RADIO THAT UNLESS MRA679 WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA THAT THE HAZE MAY NOT ALLOW THE PILOT TO SEE THE AIRPORT. AT 2015CST, ZHU STATED THEY WOULD CLEAR MRA679 FOR THE RNAV APPROACH INSTEAD. MRA679 WAS ASKED IF HE WAS RNAV CAPABLE, TO WHICH MRA679 INITIALLY STATED NEGATIVE. WHEN ASKED AGAIN, MRA679 RESPONDED AGAIN, BUT THE TRANSMISSION WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE. THE LAST TRANSMISSION OCCURRED AT 2015:56CST. WHILE ZHU WAS COORDINATING WITH KVCT TO TRY TO BRING MRA679 BACK, THE CONTROLLER AT KVCT SAW POLICE CARS WITH EMERGENCY LIGHTS FLASHING ALONG THE HIGHWAY. THE CALL TO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE CONFIRMED THAT AN ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED. ",,,,,,,,,
